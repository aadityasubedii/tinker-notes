# Connecting Weights & Biases (W&B) to Track Training

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

### 1. Install W&B
```bash
pip install wandb
```

### 2. Login to W&B
```bash
wandb login
```
This will ask for your API key. Get it from: https://wandb.ai/authorize

### 3. Add W&B Config to Your Training Script
In your training_example.py, add these two parameters to the Config:

```python
config = train.Config(
    # ... other settings ...
    wandb_project="project-name",        # Your project name on W&B
    wandb_name="training-example",     # Name for this specific run
)
```

## What You Already Have
Your training_example.py (lines 40-41) already has W&B configured! ✓

## What Happens When You Run
1. The training script automatically logs metrics (loss, learning rate, etc.) to W&B
2. Go to https://wandb.ai/your-username/project-name to see:
   - Loss curves (training & validation)
   - Learning rate schedule
   - GPU usage
   - Training progress in real-time

## Run Your Training
```bash
python tinker-cookbook/training_example.py
```

## View Results
After starting training, the terminal will show a link like:
` View run at: https://wandb.ai/your-username/project-name/runs/abc123`

Click it to see your loss curves!

## Optional: Disable W&B (if needed)
Remove or comment out the `wandb_project` and `wandb_name` lines from Config.
